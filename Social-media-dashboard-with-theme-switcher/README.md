## Acknowledgments

Thank you to everyone who took their time to check out my solution. this small project took me just one sitting to complete building the UI, One thing that it  took me a bit longer than what I expected is understanding Prefers-color-scheme and how to implement it.

Here are a couple of articles that I found so interesting about Prefers-color-scheme, I highly recommend checking them out.
